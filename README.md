## Visual Design

### Wireframes and Project Board

Wireframes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4unq4sarqAHbu1q9Jb_lBFvokq2BNIJ/view?usp=sharing

- I used the projects board to help me plan my website. I have found it a useful check guide since it was introduced and have decided to continue using it on my projects.
- The plan allowed me to focus on achieving what was most important to include in my website first before attempting to achieve other features.
- It is also a useful tool to see how I could develop my website in the future or without time constraints.

### Fonts

- The primary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">Outfit</a> was chosen because it provides clear and legible text. It is a font that provides a modern appearance and works effectively on all the buttons for the quiz. This sans-serif font
  combines smoothly with my color schemes across the website. It provides a good contrast from the font chosen for my title.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/question_screen.png" alt="Josefin Sans font ">
</div>

- The secondary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans">Josefin Sans</a> was chosen to give the heading elegance and flair.It is a classic font which provides a retro feel which means it compliments the modern font choice of Outfit. The font works well with large text and functions well as a heading for this creative project of the quiz.

### Favicon

- The favicon is linked from the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Fontawesome</a>Icon library.
- My Favicon was then generated by <a href="https://favicon.io/">favicon.io</a> and the globe is fitting for the capitals and countries focus of the website.

### Colors

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/color_palette.png" alt="color choices">
</div>

- I picked the colors (image above is a screenshot taken from <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>) of the website from the hero image using an <a href="https://imagecolorpicker.com/">image color picker</a> tool to help me with my choices.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/main_image_colors.png" alt="color choices chosen from main image">
</div>

- I varied some of the shades recommended by the image color picker so my website had sufficient contrast.
- The midnight green was quite a dark background choice and the color picker from image resulted in lighter shade recommendation. However, It was neither a dark nor light background and it proved problematic to match other colors with it whilst maintaining a good contrast level.
- This resulted in my other color choices needing to be sufficiently bright to give a good contrast level.
- The midnight green background provides a great backdrop for the lighter colors of ash grey and khaki.
- Text for the question and answer options are black and bold against their lighter background choices.
- When the user answers the question, the question and answer options seemlessly change background color depending on the user's answer and the text color changes to white to reflect the changed darker backgrounds.
- White was chosen for the main-headings as it stands out against the midnight green background color

### Images

- The main image on the homepage was chosen as it is an ideal choice for both countries and capitals.

### Styling

- I used Bootstrap 5.3 classes where possible to support with positioning, text style and size.
- I have applied my preferred colors and fonts using custom css.
- I have added in JavaScript classes using hide or display none in different places so that the user always remains on the same page.
- The answer buttons are also added dynamically through JavaScript and then styled using classes in CSS.
