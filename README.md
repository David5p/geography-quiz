## Visual Design

### Wireframes and Project Board

Wireframes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4unq4sarqAHbu1q9Jb_lBFvokq2BNIJ/view?usp=sharing

- I used the projects board to help me plan my website. I have found it a useful check guide since it was introduced and have decided to continue using it on my projects.
- The plan allowed me to focus on achieving what was most important to include in my website first before attempting to achieve other features.
- It is also a useful tool to see how I could develop my website in the future or without time constraints.

### Fonts

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/visual_design/font_choice.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a> was chosen because it provides both readability and style. It is a font that is user friendly providing warmth and also a gives the website a professional feel. This sans-serif font combines well with the color schemes chosen in the website ensuring readability on each section of the website and provides a good contrast from the headings font.

- The secondary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tourney">Tourney</a> was chosen to make the headings stand out and provide a font style which transforms the headings in headlines. It is also a font which is seen in sports stadiums so I felt it complimented The Ashes theme. The font works well with large text and combines well with the style and professional feel of the primary font choice.

### Icons

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/visual_design/icons.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are linked from the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Fontawesome</a> Icon library and are applied as classes using the i tag.
- By applying them through classes, they are suited to having styles applied to them. I was able to target them in my footer using custom css.
- Through targeting the icons using custom css, I was able to ensure sufficient contrast with my background as well as permitting sufficient padding between the icons.
- My Favicon came from <a href="https://favicon.io/">favicon.io</a> and combines well with the focus of the website.

### Colors

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/test/color_palette.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- I picked the colors (image above is a screenshot taken from <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>) of the website from the hero image using an <a href="https://imagecolorpicker.com/">image color picker</a> tool to help me with my choices.
- The green and brown colors combine well and are colors which are synonymous with the cricket and The Ashes.
  . I initially picked a light green for the navbar, icons and for styling the buttons but this presented some contrast issues with the dark green and brown so I changed to a light blue which compliments my other color choices well.
- Text for paragraphs or sub-headings is written in either black or a dark green where there is a white background and this ensure clear legibility of the writing.
- The dark brown font for the main-headings displays a good contrast on white backgrounds whilst also suiting the theme of The Ashes.
- The white and light blue used predominantly in the navbar and footer stand out against the two backgrounds.

### Images

- The main image on the homepage was chosen as it defines what the trophy and history the players will be playing for.
  . The gallery page is displayed in a responsive way thanks to the Bootstrap grid system seeing the layout change for the various devices.

### Styling

- I used Bootstrap 5.3 classes where possible to support with positioning, text style and size.
- I have applied my preferred colors and fonts using custom css.
